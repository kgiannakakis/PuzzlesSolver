    <h2>Eight Queens</h2>
    <p>This is the classic game of placing 8 queens on the chessboard, without
       one attacking another. Click on a square to place a queen. Re-click to
       remove the queen. This is harder than it initially seems, so a
       <input value="Tip" onclick="alert('Place first queen on a2 and second on b4.')" type="submit">
       may be useful.
       If you still can't solve it, you can ask the application to solve it for you.
    </p>

    <p> There is a total of 92 different solutions for this riddle.
        If symmetrical solutions (through 90, 180, 270 degrees rotation) are
        considered identical, the actual number of different solutions is 23.
        This riddle is commonly used  as an example problem for algorithm design.
    </p>

    <h2>Knight's Tour</h2>
    <p>This is another classic. Objective of the game is to guide the knight
       through all of the chessboard's squares. You must end one knight's move
       away from the first move. Click on a highlighted square to move the
       knight. Clicking on the last visited square will undo the last move.
       You can also click "Undo" at the menu.</p>

    <p>Select "Settings" to play variations of the puzzle.  You can
       change the size of the board (up to 12x12). You can also play the puzzle
       without the need to end one knight move away from the first position
       (uncheck the Reentrant option). If you uncheck the Knight's move only
       option, then you can also move three squares afar in the same column
       or row.
    </p>

    <p>The following table depicts a famous solution to the problem by Leonard Euler,
       great mathematician of 18th century.</p>

    <p>A knight can pass sequentially through all the squares. Besides this, the square is
       also a "semi magic square". That is, the sum of all rows and columns is equal (260). The
       square is not a "full magic square", because the sum of the two primary diagonals
       is not the same with the sum of the rows and the columns. However the square has
       another interesting property. The sum of every half row and every half column is 130,
       that is the half of the sum of every row and column! In case you are wondering, it is
       impossible to build an 8x8 square that is both a full magic square and a knight' tour!

    <h2>Solo</h2>

    <p>I suppose everyone has tried this at least once before. The game is won
       if just one peg remains on the board. You remove a peg by moving another
       one over it. The peg that moves must be located right next to the one
       that is removed and must land to a free spot exactly two pegs away.
       Only horizontal and vertical moves are allowed. Click a peg that is
       allowed to move to select it and then click an empty spot to jump over
       the peg in the middle. Select "Undo" from the menu to undo your last move.
